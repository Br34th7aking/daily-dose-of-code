**Zip files on server and then download them**

I learned how to do this in PHP. The running example can be seen here:[Zip Script]( http://zip-test.abhijitraj.com/)

The script zips all the files whose links are provided in the same row as the download button. 

Code files are in **zip_script** folder of this repository. Upload it to a webserver/local server to see how it functions.
